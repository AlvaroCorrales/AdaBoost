# Implementation of AdaBoost algorithm from scratch

This repository contains an implementation of the AdaBoost algorithm for binary classification problems from scratch. It was made following the description of the algorithm in "The Elements of Statistical Learning", by Hasti, Tibshirani and Friedman (chapter 10, algorithm 10.1).

As of April 2021, this repository is work in progress.
